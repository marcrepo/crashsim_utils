<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>System Calls and Error Codes found in National Vuln DB</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF"  text="#000000" link="#000080" vlink="#800080">The table below contains Linux sycalls and syscall error names (eg EXDEV) that appear in CVE entries 
    of the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database</a>(2002-October 2019). 
    <br>
    <br>
    Click on the system call or error name link to jump to a listing of all CVEs that contains the sytem
    call and/or error name in the description. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Syscalls or error names that appear together in a CVE description are grouped together - for example
    if a CVE description contains the words 'chroot' and 'clone' then the link to that CVE will show both words.
    This was added to help find CVEs that might be "interesting" for use with Crashsim.  
    <br>
    <br>
    Note: The following syscalls were not matched because their names were too generic 
    and had too many hits in the CVE listing - open, close, read, write, access, reboot, connect, send<br><br><br><TABLE id="toptable" width=100% border=2><caption>Linux System Calls and Error Codes

A mirror zone is similar to a zone of type secondary, except that its data is subject to DNSSEC validation before being used in answers, as if it had been looked up via traditional recursion, and when mirror zone data cannot be validated, BIND falls back to using traditional recursion instead of the mirror zone. However, an error in the validity checks for the incoming zone data can allow an on-path attacker to replace zone data that was validated with a configured trust anchor with forged data of the attacker's choosing.

The reactive jamming simply detects the start of a RF message sent by a component of the ABUS Secvest wireless <u><b>alarm</b></u> system, for instance a wireless motion detector (FUBW50000) or a remote control (FUBE50014 or FUBE50015), and overlays it with random data before the original RF message ends. Thereby, the receiver (<u><b>alarm</b></u> central) is not able to properly decode the original transmitted signal. This enables an attacker to suppress correctly received RF messages of the wireless <u><b>alarm</b></u> system in an unauthorized manner, for instance status messages sent by a detector indicating an intrusion.</TD></TR><TR><TD><a target="_blank" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9659">CVE-2019-9659</a></TD><TD>The Chuango 433 MHz burglar-<u><b>alarm</b></u> product line uses static codes in the RF remote control, allowing an attacker to arm, disarm, or trigger the <u><b>alarm</b></u> remotely via replay attacks, as demonstrated by Chuango branded products, and non-Chuango branded products such as the Eminent EM8617 OV2 Wifi Alarm System.</TD></TR><TR><TD><a target="_blank" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9861">CVE-2019-9861</a></TD><TD>Due to the use of an insecure RFID technology (MIFARE Classic), ABUS proximity chip keys (RFID tokens) of the ABUS Secvest FUAA50000 wireless <u><b>alarm</b></u> system can easily be cloned and used to deactivate the <u><b>alarm</b></u> system in an unauthorized way.</TD></TR><TR><TD><a target="_blank" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9863">CVE-2019-9863</a></TD><TD>Due to the use of an insecure algorithm for rolling codes in the ABUS Secvest wireless <u><b>alarm</b></u> system FUAA50000 3.01.01 and its remote controls FUBE50014 and FUBE50015, an attacker is able to predict valid future rolling codes, and can thus remotely control the <u><b>alarm</b></u> system in an unauthorized way.</TD></TR><TABLE><br><br><hr><br><br><TABLE id="alarm signal" width=100% cellspacing=6 border=2><caption>alarm signal  <a href="#toptable">(return to Syscall List)</a></caption><TR><TD><a target="_blank" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9860">CVE-2019-9860</a></TD><TD>Due to unencrypted <u><b>signal</b></u> communication and predictability of rolling codes, an attacker can "desynchronize" an ABUS Secvest wireless remote control (FUBE50014 or FUBE50015) relative to its controlled Secvest wireless <u><b>alarm</b></u> system FUAA50000 3.01.01, so that sent commands by the remote control are not accepted anymore.</TD></TR><TR><TD><a target="_blank" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9862">CVE-2019-9862</a></TD><TD>An issue was discovered on ABUS Secvest wireless <u><b>alarm</b></u> system FUAA50000 3.01.01 in conjunction with Secvest remote control FUBE50014 or FUBE50015.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the state of the PPP IP Control Protocol (IPCP). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by making an ISDN call to an affected device and sending traffic through the ISDN channel prior to successful PPP authentication. Alternatively, an unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through an affected device that is configured to <u><b>exit</b></u> via an ISDN connection for which both the Dialer interface and the Basic Rate Interface (BRI) have been configured, but the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) password for PPP does not match the remote end.

This application is installed on the device and an attacker who can provide the right payload can execute code on the user's system directly. Any breach of this system can allow an attacker to get access to all the data that the user has access too. The application uses a dynamic <u><b>link</b></u> library(DLL) called "avilib.dll" which is used by the application to send binary packets to the device that allow to control the device. One such action that the DLL provides is change password in the function "sendchangename" which allows a user to change the Wi-Fi name on the device. This function calls a sub function "sub_75876EA0" at address 0x758784F8. The function determines which action to execute based on the parameters sent to it. The "sendchangename" passes the datastring as the second argument which is the name we enter in the textbox and integer 1 as first argument. The rest of the 3 arguments are set to 0.

Amcrest cloud services does not perform a thorough verification when allowing the user to add a new camera to the user's account to ensure that the user actually owns the camera other than knowing the serial number of the camera. This can allow an attacker who knows the serial number to easily add another user's camera to an attacker's cloud account and control it completely. This is possible in case of any camera that is currently not a part of an Amcrest cloud account or has been removed from the user's cloud account. Also, another requirement for a successful attack is that the user should have rebooted the camera in the last two hours. However, both of these conditions are very likely for new cameras that are sold over the Internet at many ecommerce websites or vendors that sell the Amcrest products. The successful attack results in an attacker being able to completely control the camera which includes being able to view and <u><b>listen</b></u> on what the camera can see, being able to change the motion detection settings and also be able to turn the camera off without the user being aware of it.

Usage of the `package` key to <u><b>rename</b></u> dependencies in `Cargo.toml` is ignored in Rust 1.25.0 and prior. When Rust 1.25.0 and prior is used Cargo may download the wrong dependency, which could be squatted on crates.io to be a malicious package. This not only affects manifests that you write locally yourself, but also manifests published to crates.io. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.25.0 is affected by this advisory because Cargo will ignore the `package` key in manifests. Rust 1.26.0 through Rust 1.30.0 are not affected and typically will emit an error because the `package` key is unstable. Rust 1.31.0 and after are not affected because Cargo understands the `package` key. Users of the affected versions are strongly encouraged to update their compiler to the latest available one. Preventing this issue from happening requires updating your compiler to be either Rust 1.26.0 or newer. There will be no point release for Rust versions prior to 1.26.0. Users of Rust 1.19.0 to Rust 1.25.0 can instead apply linked patches to mitigate the issue.</TD></TR><TR><TD><a target="_blank" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17575">CVE-2019-17575</a></TD><TD>A file-<u><b>rename</b></u> filter bypass exists in admin/media/<u><b>rename</b></u>.php in WBCE CMS 1.4.0 and earlier.

All functionalities available in Sunny Explorer can effectively be done from anywhere within the network as long as an attacker gets the packet <u><b>setup</b></u> correctly. This includes the authentication process for all (including hidden) access levels and the changing of settings in accordance with the gained access rights. Furthermore, because the SMAdata2+ communication channel is unencrypted, an attacker capable of understanding the protocol can eavesdrop on communications. NOTE: the vendor's position is that authentication with encryption is not required on an isolated subnetwork.

It was identified that the device uses custom Python code called "rodman" that allows the mobile appication to interact with the device. The APIs that are a part of this rodman Python file allow the mobile application to interact with the device using a secret, which is a uuid4 based session identifier generated by the device the first <u><b>time</b></u> it is set up. However, in some cases, these APIs can also use a security code. This security code is nothing but the PIN number set by the user to interact with the device when using the touch interface on the router.

The vulnerability arises with certain unclosed tags in emails that cause markup to be handled incorrectly leading to scan <u><b>time</b></u>outs. In Apache SpamAssassin, using HTML::Parser, we <u><b>setup</b></u> an object and hook into the begin and end tag event handlers In both cases, the "open" event is immediately followed by a "close" event - even if the tag *does not* close in the HTML being parsed. Because of this, we are missing the "text" event to deal with the object normally. This can cause carefully crafted emails that might take more scan <u><b>time</b></u> than expected leading to a Denial of Service. The issue is possibly a bug or design decision in HTML::Parser that specifically impacts the way Apache SpamAssassin uses the module with poorly formed html. The exploit has been seen in the wild but not believed to have been purposefully part of a Denial of Service attempt.

Various rules can be configured to limit the types of updates that can be performed by a client, depending on the key used when sending the update request. Unfortunately, some rule types were not initially documented, and when documentation for them was added to the Administrator Reference Manual (ARM) in change #3112, the language that was added to the ARM at that <u><b>time</b></u> incorrectly described the behavior of two rule types, krb5-subdomain and ms-subdomain. This incorrect documentation could mislead operators into believing that policies they had configured were more restrictive than they actually were.

However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to <u><b>time</b></u> the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto.

internal components. Those other components will decode any URI passed to them. To protect against directory traversal the Grails Resource Plugin did the following: normalized the URI, checked the normalized URI did not step outside the appropriate root directory (e.g. the web application root), decoded the URI and checked that this did not introduce additional /../ (and similar) sequences. A bug was introduced where the Grails Resource Plugin before 1.2.13 returned the decoded version of the URI rather than the normalized version of the URI after the directory traversal check. This exposed a double decoding vulnerability. To address this issue, the Grails Resource Plugin now repeatedly decodes the URI up to three <u><b>times</b></u> or until decoding no longer changes the URI. If the decode limit of 3 is exceeded the URI is rejected. A side-effect of this is that the Grails Resource Plugin is unable to serve a resource that includes a '%' character in the full path to the resource. Not all environments are vulnerable because of the differences in URL resolving in different servlet containers. Applications deployed to Tomcat 8 and Jetty 9 were found not not be vulnerable, however applications deployed to JBoss EAP 6.3 / JBoss AS 7.4 and JBoss AS 7.1 were found to be vulnerable (other JBoss versions weren't tested). In certain cases JBoss returns JBoss specific vfs protocol urls from URL resolution methods (ClassLoader.getResources). The JBoss vfs URL protocol supports resolving any file on the filesystem. This made the directory traversal possible. There may be other containers, in addition to JBoss, on which this vulnerability is exposed.</TD></TR><TR><TD><a target="_blank" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-0702">CVE-2016-0702</a></TD><TD>The MOD_EXP_CTIME_COPY_FROM_PREBUF function in crypto/bn/bn_exp.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g does not properly consider cache-bank access <u><b>times</b></u> during modular exponentiation, which makes it easier for local users to discover RSA keys by running a crafted application on the same Intel Sandy Bridge CPU core as a victim and leveraging cache-bank conflicts, aka a "CacheBleed" attack.</TD></TR><TR><TD><a target="_blank" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10530">CVE-2016-10530</a></TD><TD>The airbrake module 0.3.8 and earlier defaults to sending environment variables over HTTP.
